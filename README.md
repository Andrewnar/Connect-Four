# Connect Four
Project goal is to create a text based connect four game and create an AI opponent. 
## Motivation
This project exists to teach myself of creating a very primitive AI oponent. I plan on improving this project in the future by making a Machine Learning progrma to replace the original AI. 
## Progress
Project is almost complete in terms of the board game. The oponent AI must still be created and future plans to improve the AI are currently being researched
